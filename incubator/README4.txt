A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

For example, take 153 (3 digits), which is narcisstic:

    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
